# Unity Gateway (`ug`)

Existing `ucode` commands continue to work unchanged. Going forward, the CLI is named Unity
Gateway and its primary command is `ug`; `ucode` remains a supported alias.

Unity Gateway is a lightweight launcher for running Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode,
GitHub Copilot CLI, and Pi through Databricks.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+ — install with `uv` ([uv.astral.sh](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/))
- `npm` if tool CLIs need to be installed automatically

## Installation

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/databricks/ucode
```

Check your version with `ug --version`. Between releases this looks like
`0.1.0+14.g93986a8` — the trailing `g<hash>` is the exact commit the build came
from, so include it when reporting a bug.

---

## Usage

Just run the tool you want:

```bash
ug codex      # OpenAI Codex
ug claude     # Claude Code
ug gemini     # Gemini CLI
ug opencode   # OpenCode
ug copilot    # GitHub Copilot CLI
ug pi         # Pi
ug cursor     # Cursor Agent (MCP only — see below)
```

On first launch, `ug` will prompt for your Databricks workspace URL, authenticate, and configure that tool automatically. Subsequent Claude and Codex launches use the generated local settings directly. Use `ug claude --refresh` or `ug codex --refresh` when you want to re-check Databricks and update the model/configuration.

Pass flags directly to the underlying tool:

```bash
ug claude -r          # resume last session
ug codex --full-auto
```

All agents route through Databricks AI Gateway using your workspace credentials — no API keys required.

Smart routing is opt-in for Codex and Claude Code. Enabling it for a launch asks the AI Gateway
router to select models for that session and its subagents. Codex may require one-time review of
the launch-scoped hooks through `/hooks`.

```bash
ug codex --enable-smart-routing
ug claude --enable-smart-routing
```

The flag applies only to that launch; later launches use normal model selection unless the flag is
passed again. Smart routing uses the `task_v1` router by default. Power users can select another
router for a launch by setting `SMART_ROUTER_NAME`, for example
`SMART_ROUTER_NAME=task_v2 ug codex --enable-smart-routing`.

To configure all tools at once:

```bash
ug configure
```

To configure specific tools without the picker, pass a comma-separated list:

```bash
ug configure --agents claude,codex
```

Available agent names are `codex`, `claude`, `gemini`, `opencode`, `copilot`, and `pi`. `cursor` is also accepted (MCP-only — it registers Databricks MCP servers but configures no models).

Naming agents explicitly is treated as a request for all of them: if any one isn't available on the workspace, the run fails without configuring the others. Add `--skip-unavailable` to configure the available subset instead and skip the rest with a warning:

```bash
ug configure --agents claude,codex,pi --skip-unavailable
```

This is useful in CI against a mix of workspaces — on a workspace whose AI Gateway exposes no OpenAI models, the command above still configures `claude` and `pi`, and reports Codex as skipped. It exits non-zero only when none of the requested agents are available.

To configure without the workspace picker, pass a comma-separated list of workspaces:

```bash
ug configure --workspaces https://first.databricks.com,https://second.databricks.com
```

When multiple workspaces are provided, `ug` logs into and saves state for each workspace. Launch commands such as `ug codex` use the first workspace in the list.

Alternatively, pass existing Databricks CLI profiles (from `~/.databrickscfg`) instead of workspace URLs — each profile's host supplies the workspace URL:

```bash
ug configure --profiles DEFAULT --agents claude,codex
```

Auth behaves the same as `--workspaces`: an OAuth `databricks auth login` is forced by default.

For CI or headless environments where the profile holds a personal access token (`auth_type = pat` in `~/.databrickscfg`), add `--use-pat`. It must be combined with `--profiles` — ug never picks up a PAT implicitly — and runs no interactive login: the profile's token is used for the whole setup (and by launched agents afterwards), with workspace access verified against the AI Gateway. `--skip-validate` additionally skips the post-configure test message sent through each agent, so configure only writes config files with the freshly discovered models. Together these make setup fully non-interactive:

```bash
ug configure --profiles DEFAULT --agents claude,codex --use-pat --skip-validate --skip-upgrade
```

### MCP servers (optional)

```bash
ug configure mcp
```

Add Databricks MCP servers to installed MCP-capable tools: Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, GitHub Copilot CLI, and Cursor Agent.
Options are shown in this order:

- Discovered external MCP connections
- Databricks SQL
- Managed Databricks MCPs (Vector Search, UC Functions, etc.)
- Custom MCP server URL

Discovered external MCP connections are listed directly.

Every Databricks MCP server is registered as a local **stdio** server that runs `ug mcp-proxy`
— a small bridge (shipped with `ug`) between the coding tool and the Databricks
streamable-HTTP MCP endpoint. The proxy mints a fresh OAuth token from your Databricks CLI profile
on every request, so MCP auth is handled uniformly for every client and never expires mid-session.
The coding tool starts and stops the proxy as a child process; there's nothing extra to run.

**Cursor** is MCP-only: `cursor-agent` runs models on your own Cursor account, so `ug`
configures no models for it — it only registers Databricks MCP servers in `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
(via the same proxy). Include it with `ug configure --agents cursor` or pick it in
`ug configure mcp`, then launch with `ug cursor`.

To set up an agent and its MCP server(s) in one command, pass `--mcp` with fully-qualified
service name(s) to `ug configure`:

```bash
ug configure --agents claude --mcp system.ai.slack
```

`--mcp` also works without `--agents` for MCP-only clients (it configures just the workspace,
then registers the servers); pass a comma-separated list to register several at once.

#### Add servers without replacing existing ones

`ug configure mcp` **replaces** the registered MCP servers with your selection — anything
outside a `--location`/`--services` scope (or left unchecked in the picker) is removed. To
**add** servers while leaving everything already configured in place, use `ug mcp add`:

```bash
# Register a whole schema's services, keeping any servers already configured.
ug mcp add --location system.ai

# Register just a subset (same name rules as `configure mcp --services`).
ug mcp add --services system.ai.slack,system.ai.github

# No arguments launches the same interactive picker, but never removes servers.
ug mcp add
```

`ug mcp add` takes the same `--location` and `--services` options as `ug configure mcp`;
the only difference is that it never removes servers outside the selection. In the interactive
picker, servers you already have configured are shown as `(already configured)` and can't be
toggled off — you only pick new ones to add.

Pass `--agents` to target specific coding agents. Any named agent that isn't set up yet is
configured first (workspace + models), so this doubles as one-command setup:

```bash
# Set up Claude Code (if needed) and register the server for it, in one command.
ug mcp add --agents claude --services system.ai.slack

# Target several agents at once.
ug mcp add --agents claude,codex --location system.ai
```

Without `--agents`, the server is registered for every already-configured agent.

#### Remove configured servers

To unregister servers you've already configured, use `ug mcp remove`:

```bash
ug mcp remove

# Remove only from specific agents. A server registered on several agents is
# unregistered from the named ones and kept on the rest.
ug mcp remove --agents codex
```

It shows the servers you currently have configured — each with the coding tools it's registered
on — and removes the ones you select from those tools. It needs no Databricks login.

### Skills (optional)

Configure Unity Catalog Skills for your coding tools with `ug configure skills`:

```bash
# Utility tools only: register the schema-less skills MCP connection, no download.
ug configure skills

# Download mode: fetch every skill in the schema to disk (and register the connection).
ug configure skills --location main.default --path /abs/project/dir

# Download a named subset of the schema's skills instead of all of them.
ug configure skills --location main.default --skill my-skill

# MCP mode: expose the schema's skills as MCP tools instead of downloading.
ug configure skills --location main.default,ml.prod --mcp
```

- **Bare command** (no `--location`) registers the schema-less skills MCP connection — the
  cross-schema utility tools only — and downloads nothing. `--mcp` with no `--location` does the
  same.
- **Download mode** (with `--location`, no `--mcp`) writes each skill flat as `<leaf>/SKILL.md`
  (plus its bundled files) into both `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/`. `--path` (an existing
  absolute project directory) is optional; when omitted, skills are written to user-level skill
  directories. Any pre-existing skill dir prompts before it's overwritten. It then registers a
  schema-less skills MCP connection, leaving any prior `--mcp` scope untouched.
  `--skill <name>[,<name>…]` narrows the download to the named skills (by leaf name) from the schema
  instead of all of them; requested names not found in the schema warn and are skipped. `--skill`
  requires a single `--location`, is download-only, and is rejected with `--mcp`.
- **MCP mode** (`--location … --mcp`) sets the connection's location set to exactly `<list>`
  (override-only) and rebuilds its `?schema=` URL; no files are downloaded and `--path` is rejected.

Each run prints the registered server, its URL, the configured agents, and its tools, and reminds
you to run `ug <agent>` (existing agent sessions need a restart before the MCP tools load).

#### Add skill scopes without replacing existing ones

`ucode skill add` registers skills additively, keeping anything already configured. With `--mcp` it
adds the schemas to the connection's scope, otherwise it downloads their skills to disk. `--skills`
narrows a download to a subset of one schema's skills.

```bash
# Add schemas to the skills MCP scope, keeping any already configured.
ucode skill add --location main.default,ml.prod --mcp

# Download a schema's skills to disk, keeping existing downloads.
ucode skill add --location main.default

# Download a named subset, by bare name (with --location) or fully-qualified name.
ucode skill add --location main.default --skills my-skill,other-skill
ucode skill add --skills main.default.my-skill,main.default.other-skill
```

### Exporting the config

Any user (not only admins) can print the workspace's managed config as portable JSON with `ug
export`. The output leads with the source `workspace` URL and a `spec_version` (the export format
version), followed by the canonical external config; credentials and server-assigned fields (the
resource name, timestamps, user ids) are excluded. Without `--file` the JSON is written to stdout;
with `--file`/`-f` the same bytes are written to a file (atomically, and the destination's parent
directory must already exist) while stdout stays empty.

```bash
# Print the managed config as JSON.
ug export

# Write it to a file; stdout stays empty.
ug export --file ./managed-config.json
```

The output looks like:

```json
{
  "workspace": "https://<workspace-host>",
  "spec_version": 1,
  "default_agent": "CODING_AGENT_CLAUDE_CODE",
  "enabled_agents": [ ... ]
}
```
