"""Admin-authored managed coding-agent config: fetch, normalize, and local persistence.

An org admin authors a ``CodingAgentConfig`` through the Databricks AI Gateway; developers read it
(non-admin) and ``ucode`` applies it locally. This module owns the fetch/normalize side and the one
local file, ``~/.ucode/managed-state.json`` (0600), that both roles share:

- fetching the raw manifest (via :func:`ucode.databricks.fetch_managed_coding_agent_configs`),
- normalizing the proto-JSON into a stable internal dict keyed by ucode's own tool names,
- persisting it via :func:`save_managed_state` / :func:`load_managed_state` — the admin-write side
  (``managed_setup`` / ``managed_wizard``) authors the manifest here, and the launch path pulls the
  published copy back into the same file, and
- re-reading it on each launch, falling back to the persisted copy when the read fails.

There is deliberately one file, not a separate authored ``managed-settings.json``: the workspace is
the source of truth, so an authored draft and the pulled copy are the same shape and coexist in
``managed-state.json``. ``ucode setup`` authors the draft; ``ucode publish`` publishes it; a launch
then pulls the published copy back into the same file.

:func:`refresh_managed_config` is the launch path's entry point. It is called before model discovery,
because the manifest decides whether that discovery is needed at all; the launch path then hands the
manifest to :func:`ucode.managed_resolve.resolve_state` once the state it layers over is final.
Deciding *which* value wins for a given key is :mod:`ucode.managed_resolve`'s job, kept separate so
that logic stays pure and I/O-free.
